Ques. 17. Design a scheduler following non-preemptive scheduling approach to schedule the processes that arrives at different 
units and having burst time double the arrival time. Scheduler selects the process with largest burst time from the queue for 
the execution. Process is not being preempted until it finishes its service time. Compute the average waiting time and average 
turnaround time. What should be the average waiting time if processes are executed according to Shortest Job First scheduling 
approach with the same attribute values.

Q44. Develop a scheduler which submits processes to the processor in the following scenario and compute the scheduler performance 
by providing the waiting time for process, turnaround time for process and average waiting time and turnaround time.
Considering the arrival time and burst time requirement of the process the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the 
processor after every 6 units of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler then checks 
for the number of process waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the processor every 
10 unit of time and considers the completion of the processes in this iteration. The scheduler checks the number of processes 
waiting in the queue for the processor after the second iteration and gives the processor to the process which needs more time to 
complete than the other processes to go in the terminated state.
The inputs for the number of requirements arrival time and burst time should be provided by the user.
